# Guess-The-Number-Game
Number Guessing Game (Python + pyttsx3)

A fun Number Guessing Game built using Python where the computer thinks of a random number and the player tries to guess it.
The game also uses text-to-speech (pyttsx3) to talk to the player and make the game interactive.

How the Game Works

The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 50

The player has 7 attempts to guess the correct number

After each guess, the game gives feedback:

Too low 📉

Too high 📈

Correct 🎉

The program speaks instructions and results using text-to-speech

Technologies Used
